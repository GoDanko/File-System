# File-System
Since the project of my Environment is so vast (my main project which is still privated), and I'm focusing on the File System for it most of the time Anyway, I decided to simply give the FS a totally new repo, so it can become an achievable goal, rather than just a pursuit of an infinitely large project where tying the ends becomes just overwhelming.
